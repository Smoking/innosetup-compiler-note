The Windows core font "Courier New" contain Latin, Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, and Cyrillic characters but do not contain East Asian characters, If your script includes more than one East Asian character, you must modify the FontLink of the font so that editor can display these characters.
(* The new FontLink does not take effect until you restart windows.)
